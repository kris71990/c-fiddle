# Playing with C

**Author** Kris Sakarias

**Version** 1.0.0

## About 

This repo contains some simple things I have built with C to help me learn and become familiar with the language.

### Getting Started

1. `git clone https://github.com/kris71990/c-games.git`

2. Choose a compiler 
  - For this project, I am using the open-source Clang compiler from LLVM - http://llvm.org - that is included in Apple's Dev Tools. 

      - `xcode-select --install` - to install Xcode is the simplest way,

         or

      - `brew install --with-toolchain llvm` - to install with Homebrew (this may require additional steps - https://embeddedartistry.com/blog/2017/2/20/installing-clangllvm-on-osx)

3. Navigate to individual directories to compile, test, and run each project.
