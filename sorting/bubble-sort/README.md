# Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm to implement, although it is inefficient, especially for large data sets, compared to other sorting algorithms. 

Although sorting in place in O(1) space, it requires two nested iterations of the array in order to compare and swap values. It runs in O(n^2) time.

## To Use
```
To compile: `clang -o bubble-sort.out bubble-sort.c`

To run: `./bubble-sort.out`
```
