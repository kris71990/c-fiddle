# Selection Sort

Selection sort is a basic sorting algorithm that operates by selecting the lowest value in an unsorted sublist and swapping it with the leftmost value of the unsorted sublist, which eventually creates a sorted list.

Selection sort is an in-place comparison sort, meaning it operates in O(1) space, but it is inefficient over large data sets. It generally outperforms bubble sort but is outperformed by insertion sort. All of these algorithms, including selection sort, operate in O(n^2) time.

## To Use
```
To compile: `clang -o selection-sort.out selection-sort.c`

To run: `./selection-sort.out`
```
