# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a simple terminal game of tic-tac-toe between two players. Players are instructed to choose a square numbered 1-9 to place their letter, the letter is placed and the next player does the same. The game checks before each turn to see if someone has won, and then ends the game and congratulates the winner if so.
